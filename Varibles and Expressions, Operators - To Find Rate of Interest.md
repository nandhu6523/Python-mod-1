# Experiment No: 3-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - To Find Rate of Interest

## AIM
To write a Python program to find rate of interest based on the user given principle, time & simple interest.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Input principal amount p (as float)
3. Input time t (as float)
4. Input simple interest si (as float)
5. Calculate rate r using the formula:
      r = (si × 100) / (p × t)
6. Print the rate of interest r with 2 decimal places
7. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```

p=float(input())
t=float(input())
si=float(input())
r=(si*100)/(p*t)
print("Rate of Interest : %.2f" %r)

```
