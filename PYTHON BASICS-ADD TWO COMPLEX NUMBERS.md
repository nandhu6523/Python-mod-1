Experiment No: 1 Python Basics- Add Two Complex Numbers
AIM
To create a Python program to print the to Add two complex numbers by getting the inputs using eval().

ALGORITHM
Begin the program.
Read the first input and store it in variable a.
Read the second input and store it in variable b.
Calculate the sum of a and b, store it in sum.
Print the values of a, b, and sum.
Terminate the program.
